A project Assignment for the Human-Computer Interaction Course (345) at the University of Auckland, this assignment is after planning a Lo-Fi design, and is a basic prototype for a learning-based environment.

Emphasis was on display of future features, demonstrating some core functionality but mostly focused on aesthetics to satisfy principles such as "Gestalt" grouping principles, usability factors and Nielsens 10 Heuristics (for a system). 

Design-wise, colour schemes and font choices needed to be justified.
I received an A+ Grade (43/45) for the Assignment.
