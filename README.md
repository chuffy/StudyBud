# StudyBud by Wilfred Lan
A project Assignment for the Human-Computer Interaction Course (345) at the University of Auckland, this assignment the successor of a 3-part assignment after planning a Low-fidelity design. It is a basic prototype (mostly non-functional) for a learning-based environment for high school students to aid in collaboration to help with understanding in their knowledge.

Emphasis was on display of future features, demonstrating some core functionality but mostly focused on aesthetics to satisfy principles such as "Gestalt" grouping principles, usability factors and Nielsens 10 Heuristics (for a system). 

Design-wise, colour schemes and font choices needed to be justified with reasoning.

I received an A+ Grade (43/45) for the Assignment.
